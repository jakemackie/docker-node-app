## **Clone the repository:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jakemackie/docker-node-app docker-node-app
```

> change the "docker-node-app" parameter to a folder name you'd like to save this project to.

## **Install various dependencies:**

NodeJS

```shell
npm i
```

> Please ensure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

## **Run the localhost**

```shell
npm run start
```
